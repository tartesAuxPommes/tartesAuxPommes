# ALTERNATIVE GIT
I use another git server at [violette.town](https://git.violette.town/violette), just so stuff feels
more personnal & i *own* the data.

Howdy, im Violette ! 

i'm an 22 y/o üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏ègirl studying IT in Polytech Annecy, and Sherbrooke university.
i've learned C/C++, JS/TS doing silly projects on my own, which you can find a bunch here
also did a bunch of web CTFs / crackmes

I learn a lot by doing some random stuff and messing around, so a lot of my projects here are not finished.
